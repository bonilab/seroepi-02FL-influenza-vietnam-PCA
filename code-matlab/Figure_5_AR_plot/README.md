## README FILE FOR ATTACK-RATE CODE

To generate Figure 5 of the main text (the main figure with attack rate estimates) run scripts S14 to S19 in order below.

Scripts S14 to S17 have to be run for each subtype separately, and you can set the subtype on lines 9 and 10 of each script.

Scripts S14 and S15 estimate the attack rates across all locations and in the three separate locations. 

Script S16 constructs the likelihood profiles needed to estimate confidence intervals.

Scripts S17 to S19 plot the profiles and the overall attack rate plot.
